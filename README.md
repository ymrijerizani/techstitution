# techstitution
Working together is where ideas take shape! #Techstitution is a knowledge-sharing mean and a direct contribution to create digital-based solutions. The project engages youth in democratic processes and learning of new software skills, in order to contribute to the formation of ‘smart institutions’ that deliver high-quality services to Kosovo citizens. The project is supported by the UNICEF Innovations Lab and the Austrian Development Agency. The first institutional partnership was established in November 2016 with the Regulatory Authority of Electronic and Postal Communications (RAEPC) and has resulted in digitization of the RAEPC’s services.
